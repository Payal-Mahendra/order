 	<p><center><h4>PAYAL Art Gallery began its journey in the first decade of the new millennium and geared up an evolution in the modern and contemporary art in India. For nearly a decade, PAYAL has showcased some of the unique and finest exhibitions of modern and contemporary art in India building up a gateway of Indian art in the world market. It has constantly hosted workshops, art camps, talk shows and seminar and made a landmark success in promoting Indian contemporary art at the global level. PAYAL Art Gallery presently operates from two places – one gallery is in Kolkata and the other is in New Delhi. Keeping with the latest trends of the art market, PAYAL has come up with best solutions for a wider audience of fine arts from traditional paintings, sculptures, printmaking, and graphics to new media like conceptual art, video art, installations and experimental art and started an online art shop where a buyer can opt to select and buy a piece of modern and contemporary art of his or her choice from a variety of collections.</h4></center></p>
 	<p><center><h4>PAYAL Art Gallery since its inception has been instrumental in promoting the upcoming artists and newer generation art works. The whole idea of ‘Gen Next’ exhibitions profusely dealing with contemporary art of India as well reaching out to young artists from different corners of the globe happens to be exclusively PAYAL Art Gallery’s brainchild, which has revolutionized the concept of looking at contemporary art in the new millennium and given birth to a new generation of groundbreaking contemporary artists who are doing extremely well in the art world. Authentic and original art by the Indian modern masters like Jogen Chowdhury, Satish Gujral, Kartick Pyne, Partha Pratim Deb and many others are available with the gallery and can be directly collected from different exhibitions the gallery hosts from time to time or can be purchased from home through online. In the list of groundbreaking contemporary artists, PAYAL Art Gallery has largely showcased the works of Sekhar Roy, Samindranath Majumdar, Akhil Chanra Das, Sunil Deb, Amitava Dhar and from the new generation artists - the names are Sagar Bhoumik, Rajesh Deb, Sourav Jana, Nantu Behari Das, Priyanka Lahiri, Partha Guin and many others. One can always come across their works and experience their aesthetic beauty whenever they visit in any of the galleries of PAYAL in Kolkata or New Delhi. And if someone happens to miss it in the exhibition/s, then just browse it online and make the best deal just sitting at home.</h4></center></p>
